## 1\. Setting Up the `HydrophoneAnalysis` Conda Environment

First, you need to create a Conda environment named `HydrophoneAnalysis` and install all the necessary Python libraries.

1.  **Create the Environment**: Open your terminal or Anaconda Prompt and run the following command to create a new environment with Python 3.9 (a stable choice for these libraries):

    ```bash
    conda create -n HydrophoneAnalysis python=3.9 -y
    ```

2.  **Activate the Environment**: You must activate the environment each time you want to run the script.

    ```bash
    conda activate HydrophoneAnalysis
    ```

3.  **Install Libraries**: Now, install the required packages. The most critical step is installing PyTorch, as its version depends on whether you have a CUDA-enabled GPU.

      * **Install PyTorch & Torchaudio**: For the most reliable installation, go to the [PyTorch official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and select your system's specifications (e.g., OS, Package: Conda, and your CUDA version or CPU). Copy the command they provide. For a standard CPU-only setup, the command is usually:
        ```bash
        conda install pytorch torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch
        ```
      * **Install other core packages**: Run this command to install the remaining data science and audio libraries from the `conda-forge` channel, which ensures better compatibility.
        ```bash
        conda install -c conda-forge librosa scikit-learn matplotlib -y
        ```
      * **Install `panns_inference`**: This package is best installed using `pip`.
        ```bash
        pip install panns-inference
        ```

## 2\. Configuring the Script

Before running the analysis, you **must** edit the `config` dictionary at the top of the script to match your system's file paths.

  * **`audio_folder_path`**: Change this to the full path where your `.wav` hydrophone files are stored.
  * **`output_folder`**: Change this to the full path where you want all the results (CSVs, plots, audio clips) to be saved.

Your modified configuration might look something like this:

```python
# --- Configuration ---
config = {
    # --- Paths ---
    "audio_folder_path": "D:/My_Research/Project_Azores/Hydrophone_Data",
    "output_folder": "D:/My_Research/Project_Azores/Analysis_Results",
    # ... other settings remain the same ...
}
```

You can also tune other parameters in this section, like `high_pass_filter_hz` or `dbscan_eps`, to adjust the analysis.

## 3\. Running the Analysis

With the environment set up and the script configured, you can run the analysis using one of two methods.

### Method A: Direct Execution (Command Line)

This is the most straightforward way to run the script.

1.  Save the code into a file named `analyze_hydrophone.py`.
2.  Open your terminal and activate the environment:
    ```bash
    conda activate HydrophoneAnalysis
    ```
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/script
    ```
4.  Execute the script using Python. The analysis will start, printing progress directly to your terminal.
    ```bash
    python analyze_hydrophone.py
    ```

### Method B: Jupyter Notebook

Running the script in a Jupyter Notebook is great for interactive analysis and debugging.

1.  **Install Jupyter**: If you haven't already, install Jupyter in your environment.
    ```bash
    # Make sure your 'HydrophoneAnalysis' environment is active
    conda install jupyter -y
    ```

    ```bash
    conda activate HydrophoneAnalysis
    ```
2.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: From your terminal, start the Jupyter server.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  **Run the Code**: Your web browser will open the Jupyter interface.
      * Click **New** -\> **Notebook** (and select the `HydrophoneAnalysis` kernel if prompted).
      * Copy the entire script and paste it into the first cell of the notebook.
      * Run the cell by pressing **Shift + Enter**. The analysis will begin, and the output will appear below the cell.

# HydrophoneAnomalies
An acoustic anomaly detection script for hydrophone recordings from the Statsraad Lehmkuhl. It uses PANNs embeddings and DBSCAN clustering to automatically find interesting sounds (e.g., marine life üêã), while filtering out pings from the ship's own scientific instruments. The system saves clips and spectrograms of detected events for review.
