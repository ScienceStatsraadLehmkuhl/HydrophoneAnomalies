# HydrophoneAnomalies
An acoustic anomaly detection script for hydrophone recordings from the Statsraad Lehmkuhl. It uses PANNs embeddings and DBSCAN clustering to automatically find interesting sounds (e.g., marine life 🐋), while filtering out pings from the ship's own scientific instruments. The system saves clips and spectrograms of detected events for review.
